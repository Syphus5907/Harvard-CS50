1. Program: sort1
   Algorithm: Bubble Sort
   Explanation: The program repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order, leading to the smaller elements bubbling to the top of the list.

2. Program: sort2
   Algorithm: Selection Sort
   Explanation: The program finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element, placing it in its final position one by one.

3. Program: sort3
   Algorithm: Merge Sort
   Explanation: The program divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them back together, resulting in a more uniform sorting behavior.
